				<p class="projecttitle">RAP project (Non-Skippable Adverts For Whole Swiss TV Industry)<span class="projecttag">New Project</span><span class="projecttag">AWS Cloud</span></p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Overview: </span>AWS system for introducing non-skippable adverts in to the whole Swiss TV industry for on-demand TV. It came about due to a change in broadcasting legislation because consumers were previously able to skip ads which loses ad revenue.</p>
				<p>RWEL Ltd was contracted to create the shared APIs & backend used throughout the industry and by consumer devices. An ad sales house will book a campaign and the system ultimately tries to ensure that the target impressions for the ad campaign is delivered. The system specification was quite vague and needed a lot of discussions, especially because there are so many clients. RWEL Ltd did all of the AWS development.</p>	
				<p>The APIs handle 22m requests per day.</p>

				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Used by: </span>Whole Swiss TV industry (operators, broadcasters, ad sales, audience measurement) & any consumer device capable of playing on-demand TV (STB, browser, mobile application). Companies will use the APIs to upload their data (Ad campaigns, channels, available impressions, media, EPGs etc) or try to book a campaign (if sufficient impressions available) or read data (E.g., Campaign progress or reports etc). Consumer devices will use the API to request an ad list to play out and to send playout progress events so that the system can count an impression/contact.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Components: </span>REST & SOAP APIs (ASP.NET Core Web API) for consumer devices (Request ads, notify playout events etc), APIs for managing data (Create campaigns, managing static data, manage impression inventory, APIs for reporting, APIs for monitoring information (E.g., Health checks), monitoring background tasks (E.g., Send emails, create Jiras for issues, send Datadog metrics, send MS Teams notifications), general background tasks (E.g., Campaign managment & planning, data caching, import EPGs, archiving etc), RavenDB database, Redis database & Confluence documents (Technical information, "How To" guides, troubleshooting guides etc)</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">My role: </span>I led the backend development (Team of 3). I did a lot of design work. I was responsible for getting the clients to agree on the detailed design for many of the component components due to the system specification being high level & vague. It was a very small team and I also did a lot of development work.</p>

				<p>Each test will be executed for specific languages (E.g., English, German etc), CRM users (E.g., Manager, ordinary user etc) and web browser versions (E.g., Version 50 of Chrome, version 40 of Safari).

				<p class="projecttitle">Ladbrokes BS2000 Shop System project (Shop System For Ladbrokes)</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Overview: </span>The shop system used by Ladbrokes. The system is a hybrid where bet data is in DBase files and all other data is in SQL Server and some components use CA Clipper. This is because the original system used CA Clipper for all components. Now only the ones relating to bet data are used. The eventual plan is to gradually migrate to the target system. There are a lot of shared VB6 & C++ components.</p>
				<p>The system also communicates with head office for various functions. The company was contracted to develop all of the software for Ladbrokes with minor involvement from other companies.</p>			
				<p>The project had a large amount of new development work because it was gradually migrating towards the target project.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Used by: </span>Ladbrokes shops.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Components: </span>Till application (VB6, C++, CA Clipper), document scanner, receipt printer, SQL Server database, shop server applications (Bet settlement, communication with head office etc), head office till application (Large bet authorisation, audit events, reporting etc), head office liability risk system & head office server applications (Placing shop bets against telephone betting account, recovery of missed data feed messages, management of large bet authorisation etc.)</p>

				<p class="projecttitle">EPoS OMR project (Implement OMR Betting Slips For Shops)<span class="projecttag">New Project</span></p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Overview: </span>Project to implement OMR betting slips for shop systems. E.g., Horse racing special events like Grand National, lottery & football coupons. It enables bets to be automatically added to the system without the shop staff having to translate what was written on the betting slip. Manually translating bets is a very slow process otherwise.</p>
				<p>The customer will fill in a pre-printed betting slip (E.g., Select 5 lottery numbers), the shop staff will feed it through the document scanner, a DLL will identify which type of betting slip from the barcode and then return a list of which items were ticked on the slip. The printed receipt will list which items were ticked and display the cost of the bets.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Used by: </span>Ladbrokes shops & independent bookmakers shops.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">Components: </span>DLL (C++) for recognising pre-printed betting slips (Identifies which marks were made and produces XML), a test harness for the DLL and a UI for designing OMR betting slips in Visio format.</p>
				<p><span class="projectsubtitle">My role: </span>I did about 40% of the work on the project and worked on all components. I did a lot of work on improving the accuracy of the DLL.</p>
